These updated gyro drive programs are designed to give your robot precision, consistency, and control on the FLL field. You’re welcome to use them in any mission you like, but they’re especially effective in situations where accuracy and repeatability are critical. Whether you're navigating tight spaces, aligning with mission models, or executing complex sequences, these scripts offer a reliable foundation for consistent performance.
The gyro-based straight-line driving feature helps your robot maintain a consistent heading over long distances. This is particularly useful when traveling across the mat, as it reduces drift and compensates for uneven surfaces or resistance. The turning functions allow for precise angle control, making it easier to align with field elements or transition smoothly between tasks. These turns use proportional control to minimize overshoot and improve responsiveness.
These programs are also ideal for integrating into multi-step autonomous routines. By combining gyro navigation with attachments or sensors, teams can build mission programs that execute reliably under pressure. Additionally, the code provides a great opportunity to learn about PID tuning. Adjusting proportional, integral, and derivative values can help you fine-tune your robot’s motion for smoother and more accurate behavior.
To get started, download the repository and open the .llsp3 files using the Spike Prime app. Make sure your robot is updated to the latest firmware and running the Python 3.0 environment. Once uploaded, test the scripts on your FLL mat and calibrate them to match your robot’s build and wheel configuration. You can then integrate the functions into your mission programs, either by calling them directly or customizing them to suit your strategy.
